/**
 * Tonal exports all tonal modules
 *
 * **Important: since v3 single npm packages are not supported**
 *
 * This is a facade object that exposes all tonal modules. The main purpouse
 * is to remain compatible with ES5 (require) modules.
 *
 * ```js
 * // ES6 modules (recommended: requires babel, webpack, browserify, parcel or similar tool)
 * import { Note } from 'tonal'
 * Note.midi('C4') // => 60
 *
 * // with require (node.js or ES6)
 * const { Note }= require('tonal')
 * Note.midi('C4') // => 60
 *
 * // inside browser (using the bundled package)
 * Tonal.Note.midi('C4') // => 60
 * ```js
 *
 * @module Tonal
